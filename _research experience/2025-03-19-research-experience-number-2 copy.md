*(Advisor: Prof. Xing Sheng, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University)  (June 2024 - August 2024)*  

**Project Overview:**  
Developed a dual-modality sensing platform integrating:  
1) *Hemoglobin spectral sensing*: Achieved real-time blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) monitoring through differential absorption spectroscopy of oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxyhemoglobin (Hb)  
2) *Fluorescent tracer velocimetry*: Implemented blood flow velocity measurement via time-resolved fluorescence tracking  

**Key Contributions:**  
1. **System Development**  
- Designed MATLAB-based control algorithms for multi-channel fiber-optic signal acquisition
- Optimized fluorescence excitation/detection modules with lock-in amplifcation techniques  

2. **Data Analysis**  
- Developed machine learning pipelines for spectral feature extraction  
- Achieved 92.3% classification accuracy in hemodynamic state recognition
