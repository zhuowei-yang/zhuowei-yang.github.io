**Flexible Biosensing Platform for Protein Species Detection**  
*(Advisor: [Prof. Kewang Nan](https://person.zju.edu.cn/knan), **Zhejiang University**)*<br />
*January 2025 - February 2025*  

Project Overview:  
Developed a novel protein detection system featuring:  
1. *Chemoelectric transduction interface*: Implemented flexible electronic sensors as carrier platforms, leveraging protein-specific current response variations induced by molecular charge characteristics

 - Addressed class overlap challenges via: (1) Contrastive learning for feature augmentation (increasing effective training samples by 3x); (2) Attention mechanisms to weight discriminative signal segments (e.g., 100-500Hz impedance bands for low-molecular-weight proteins)  
 - Achieved **96.7% accuracy** in differentiating 8 protein species (including albumin, IgG, and thrombin), outperforming traditional chemometric methods (PLS-DA, 78.2%) by 18.5%  
 - Validated generalizability across 3 independent datasets (n=420 samples) with <3% accuracy drop, demonstrating AI model's resilience to batch effects and environmental variations
